# Full-Custom-Digital-Design-Project
This project consists of desiging an 8-bit ALU from scratch, it includes: 
1. Creating transistor level schematics. 
2. Simulating the circuit. 
3. Drawing layouts and combining small building blocks to create the overall functional block. 

I used Cadence Virtuoso Design Environment.
